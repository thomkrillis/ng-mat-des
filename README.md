# ng-mat-des
AngularJS projects using Material Design

These projects will be using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and Google's [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) as implemented by [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/#/). Check out their [project on Github](https://github.com/angular/material).

The first project is a [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) search page, which can be viewed [here](https://thomkrillis.github.io/ng-mat-des/). It's very much in progress and needs a lot more styling and functionality.

Thanks to [Tuan Anh Tran](https://tuananh.org/2015/01/14/using-angularjs-with-jekyll/) for pointing out how to get around the common syntax between Jekyll and AngularJS.
